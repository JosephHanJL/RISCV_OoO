# An Out-of-Order RISCV Processor Based on Intel P6 Architecture

### Features
P6 Architecture, out-of-order processor with 2 ALUs, 2 4-cycle multipliers and 1 load and 1 store unit
Global branch predictor 
Early branch resolution
Both a basic p6 design where branches are resolved in the reorder buffer AND a design with early branch resolution
Pipelined fetch to handle memory latency
GUI debugger
